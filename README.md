# Voices

Experimental open source project for the Endangered Language Alliance.

Clicking on areas of an image plays an audio clip.

Drawing on an image gives you areas to record new audio clips.

## Creating a Project

When you first open the editor, it will look blank.

Find an interesting picture or photo on your computer. Drag and drop it into the web browser, or use the file select button.
I'll use this picture of me on a rainy day.

I want the audio to play when someone clicks on my umbrella, so I'm going to paint over it
with my mouse. It's OK to use any color, as long as each object is one color.

You can change colors by clicking a colorful square above the photo.

You can switch between pencil and area modes by clicking those buttons.

Now record or upload your audio files for each color, on a sidebar.

Now click 'Try It!'. The colors are hidden, but your computer remembers where the click areas are.

Clicking on the umbrella makes an audio start playing.

When you're done, click "Save" at the bottom right.

You'll be redirected to a new ready-to-use URL.
